# Best Theme for XCode

Although I'm not so great at picking names for my projects , this is really the best theme I've used with XCode.

Took me a lot of tweaking and I'm finally pleased. 

The main idea was to keep the orignal theme colors but with a dark background and with more brightness.

After using it for a while your eyes will never let you go back to a light theme ever again.

  To install, copy the file to **~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes** and restart Xcode.
